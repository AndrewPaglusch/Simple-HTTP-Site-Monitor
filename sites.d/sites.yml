#A basic check
#Follow a maximum of 5 HTTP redirects
#Don't ignore any SSL errors we may get
#Search page for "some text"
Bing:
    url: https://bing.com
    ignore_ssl_errors: false
    max_redirect: 5
    timeout: 5
    search: <title>Bing</title>
    http_headers:
      user-agent: HTTP Site Monitor

#Add some custom headers to your check
#Useful for adding a custom "user-agent"
msn.com:
    url: http://msn.com

      user-agent: HTTP Site Monitor

#A check without relying on DNS
#Add a "host" header so that the server knows to
#send us content for "website3.com"
#If we get a redirect to a different scheme of "website3.com"
#like "http://" -> "https://website3.com", it will automatically be replaced with
#the IP address in the "url" field and the "website3.com" host header will
#be placed in the new request for the redirect locaton automatically. This is to completely
#avoid any dependency on DNS and still allow us to follow redirects
#to the same hostname
